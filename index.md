I am a PhD Candidate in Computer Science at the [University of Genoa](https://sicurezza.unige.net/home).

My main interest is Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) of non-linear real arithmetic augmented with transcendental functions (NTA). In particular, my research focuses on combining the typical SMT symbolic approach with techniques from the fields of numerical methods and fixed-point theorems, in order to obtain a working framework that is both exact and effective.
